# OakUI

a collection of UI components you can share between reactJs and ReactNative.

## Why another UI Kit?

While some great UI kits exists out there, I still felt there should be a better way of sharing UI components between react and react native.

This library is aimed to tackle this exact problem.

## Key Philosophies
The main goals of this package are the following:

- cross-compatibility : migrating from one platform to another should be as simple as changing one line of code.
- lean-core: the core library should be as lean as possible while providing the most possible customization options for the developers.

to achieve these goals we had to impose some restrictions:

- we stick to react-native styling guide lines ( as it can be implemented as a subset of CSS)
- we stick to a handful of components present in react-native.

## Design

As big fan of flat designs ( I'm not a designer, i just like them cause they look cool while being easy to implement), so I decided to implement light and dark themed flat designs as the default options for this library, however, it doesn't mean you cannot create your own designs, if you can make it in react-native, you can make it here as well.
